### algs4-practice

This project is my practice work learning algorithms using [Algorithms book](http://www.informit.com/store/algorithms-9780321573513) by Robert Sedgewick.

These sources are supposed to be helpful for people who is also learning this material and stucked at some practice exercise. Please remember, there's no exact answer here on practice assignments. It's quite possible that this code contains errors ([please notify me about it](mailto:vaysman@protonmail.com)).

Yes, it has just few chapters covered.  
Yes, I uploaded a useless crude project on github.  
My bad.
